### Day 1: Febrary 5, 2017
**Today's Workout:** Rest day with Yoga 

**Thoughts:** I could stay focused in yoga class. Managed myself to do the hooks more than 5 times alone. 

### Day 2: Febrary 6, 2017
**Today's Workout:** 3 miles run: 38 min / R1: leg and back day 

**Thoughts:** Dinner before a workout was a bad idea. I had to run-stop-walk cycle many times. Let's make sure to empty the stomach before running. Weight training is absolutely about right posture. 


### Day 3: Febrary 7, 2017
**Today's Workout:** 3 miles 5km run: 31 min / no lifting day  

**Thoughts:** I honestly did not feel like running today then I remember to practice to behave against I'ms. I just watch my emotions coming and going.


### Day 4: Febrary 8, 2017
**Today's Workout:** rest day 

**Thoughts:** Puf, a long day. Pushing 3 miles to Friday and cross train Sat then KR on sunday.

### Day 5: Febrary 9, 2017
**Today's Workout:** cross 20 min walk 

**Thoughts:** Calling a day a lot ealier than usual. Two running session left for this week so my legs and mind need a full recovery 


### Day 6: Febrary 10, 2017
**Today's Workout:** rest

### Day 7: Febrary 11, 2017

**Today's Workout:** Key run week1 4miles (6.5km) 40:20 / Lifting: chest/ shoulder

**Thoughts:** It was a good session, emptying the stomach really helped. Let's stick to the training plan rather than switching training days. KR on sunday is suitable.
### Day 8: Febrary 12, 2017

**Today's Workout:** Rest day 

### Day 8: Febrary 12, 2017

**Today's Workout:** first run of the week 3miles 29:30 stable 

**Thoughts:** 
```
while (heartache) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    getBackToLife()  {
      wakeUp();
      code();
      eatHealthy();
      workOut();
      sleep();
    }}, 8.64e+7);
}
up-level();
         
```

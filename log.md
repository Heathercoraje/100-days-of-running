### Day 1: Febrary 5, 2017
**Today's Workout:** Rest day with Yoga

### Day 2: Febrary 6, 2017
**Today's Workout:** 3 miles run: 38 min / R1: leg and back day 

**Thoughts:** Dinner before a workout was a bad idea. I had to run-stop-walk cycle many times. Let's make sure to empty the stomach before running. Weight training is absolutely about right posture. 


### Day 3: Febrary 7, 2017
**Today's Workout:** 3 miles 5km run: 31 min / no lifting day  

**Thoughts:** I honestly did not feel like running today then I remember to practice to behave against I'ms. I just watch my emotions coming and going.
